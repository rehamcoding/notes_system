Notes System – Object-Oriented Practice Project
This project is a simple Notes System built using Python to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

The goal of this project is to understand how data flows between classes and how objects interact with each other through composition and relationships.

The system allows a user to:
- Create notes
- Store notes inside a notebook
- Access and manage notes through object relationships

This project focuses on:
- Class design
- Object relationships
- Data ownership and references
- Clean and readable OOP structure

Learning Objectives:
- Understand object relationships
- Practice composition between classes
- Track how data flows between objects
- Build confidence in designing small OOP systems
